Think of LangChain like LEGO blocks for AI.

Instead of building everything ourself, LangChain gives us:

🧱 Chat memory block
🧱 RAG block
🧱 API integration block
🧱 Tool-use block

We just plug them together.


-- Why people use LangChain?--

Because building everything from scratch is difficult.

LangChain gives us ready-made building blocks:

✔ Chatbots

✔ RAG systems (PDF bots / website bots / document QA)

✔ Multi-step agents

✔ Tools (Browsing, Calculator, Python interpreter, etc.)

✔ Vector DB integrations (FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma)

✔ Memory (so bot remembers previous messages)
