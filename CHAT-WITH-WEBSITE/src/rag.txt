RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation

📌 Meaning:

It is an AI technique where:
	•	Retrieval → The system first fetches relevant information from a database, documents, PDFs, website, vector store, etc.
	•	Augmented → This retrieved information is added to the prompt.
	•	Generation → The LLM (like GPT) generates the answer using that information.

🔥 Simple Example:

If you upload a 50-page PDF and ask:

“Explain chapter 3”

A normal LLM can’t do it accurately.
But RAG will:
	1.	Retrieve chapter 3 from PDF
	2.	Augment the LLM prompt with that text
	3.	Generate a correct answer

🎯 Why RAG is used in Chat-with-Website project?

Because you want your chatbot to:
	•	Understand website content
	•	Search the website
	•	Answer questions based on the website, not hallucinate



--- what Rag does------

	1.	PDFs → split into chunks
	2.	Chunks → converted to embeddings
	3.	Stored in vector DB (Pinecone)
	4.	User asks a question
	5.	Question also → embedding
	6.	Vector DB finds matching chunks
	7.	LLM reads those chunks
	8.	LLM generates correct answer
